- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darkroe
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gaming, art, philosophy, reading, and many other things. On GitHub, I am mainly interested in sfotware / hardware related topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as many of the main coding languages as I can. Currently, I am teaching myself about sockets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any software project that can help improve my understanding of both coding languages and software development as a whole.
- 📫 How to reach me: darkroe.ninbot@gmail.com. Email me about GitHub related material at that email address.
